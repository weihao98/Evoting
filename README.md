# Homomorphic Encryption and Its applications to e-voting 

Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that permits users to perform
computations on its encrypted data without first decrypting it. These resulting
computations are left in an encrypted form which, when decrypted, result in an
identical output to that produced had the operations been performed on the
unencrypted data. Homomorphic encryption can be used for privacypreserving outsourced storage and computation. This allows data to be
encrypted and out-sourced to commercial cloud environments for processing,
all while encrypted.

Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) allows the evaluation of arbitrary
circuits composed of multiple types of gates of unbounded depth, and is the
strongest notion of homomorphic encryption. It was raised [1] in 1978 but the
first FHE scheme was proposed by Gentry in his PhD thesis in 2009 [2] and
which was later extended and improved by many authors. FHE has been
becoming an important research direction and has many applications in cloud
computation, privacy-preserving machine learning, e-voting, etc. In this
project, we will investigate the FHE scheme from integers [3] and its
applications in e-voting [4]. The students are also required to implement the
resulting e-voting system.
